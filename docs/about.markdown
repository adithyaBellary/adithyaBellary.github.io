I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May of 2019 with a degree in Electrical Engineering. There, I got a chance to dip my toes in machine learning and larger software engineering applications, so I decided to scratch that itch. I fell in love.

I love the creative nature of software engineering. I feel the most fulfilled and satisfied when I am working on problems that affect a broad section of the population.
