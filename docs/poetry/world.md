Every poem we write deserves to be in a museum. <br />
Every half-thought we scribble down on a napkin, <br />
every picture we take either for ourselves or for <br />
someone else, <br/>
every video <br />
no matter how shaky our hands were is a work of art. <br />
Know that you are incredibly courageous for creating <br />
whatever you create.<br />
-- the world deserves what goes on in your head <br />
