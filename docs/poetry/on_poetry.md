Poetry is feeling.  <br/>
My feelings, <br/>
Fears, <br/>
Ambitions, <br/>
Regrets <br/>
All here on these pages. <br/>
Maybe that is why I love poetry so much, <br/>
Because each words carries with it such emotion. <br/>
This is my raw soul on the paper. <br/>
<br/>
In a deeper sense, <br/>
Poetry is truth. <br/>
It might not be the Truth, but <br/>
In its purest form, it is as <br/>
Pure a truth I can write. <br/>
These words represent my <br/>
Mind, my <br/>
Thoughts, my <br/>
Feelings. <br/>
A dissection of my being, almost. <br/>
I pick apart my brain and present it to you in <br/>
Sometimes not so nice lines and verses. <br/>
Writing is as much a journey for me as a writer  <br/>
as it is for you as a reader. <br/>
So come, <br/>
Take my hand. <br/>
Take a trip through my mind with me. <br/>
Let us go on this adventure together, and <br/>
Hopefully we will come out the other side a little bit better off. <br/>
