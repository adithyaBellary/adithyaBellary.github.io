## Building a v1 product

A little over a year ago, around March of 2020, I got asked to help build a mobile application for a local tutoring group by the name Emphasis Education. They provide educational support to kids from k-12 in the subjects that they are learning in school.

Over the past couple months, they were noticing some issues with their business operations that they were looking to solve as they looked to expand their clien-base as well as increades the number of services that they offer.

Issues:
  - protecting users' privacy
  - not kissing mon enough
  - no real brand identity
  - weak control of what is going on between tutor employees and students

They were noticing that they were taking care of a lot of business operations manually. These small tasks were adding up over time, and as they were looking to expand and take on more students, the way they were running things was not scalable.

Their current method of communication was through text message. This makes sense when the community of students and tutors are tight-knit. But there will be a time in the future when a student and a tutor will be unknown to each other. Then, it would be not be approproate to require a phone number and mandate that important communication take place in that space.

They also wanted a way to develop their brand identity. They are a relatively small group, so they were looking for a way to distinguich themselves

Once we put all these issues into a pot together and stirred them around, the solution that made the most sense was to create a customized mobile application that would be able to check all of the boxes that they had.

### The stack

Client was written in React Native. Firebase for backend and database. NodeJS Server. Graphql to connect the two

Writing this app was a great learning experience because I got to try a lot of new things and explore new libraries. I really got to create something, and that was a fantastic experience. It really opened my mind up to what it meant to be a software engineer. The only other proper software engineering experience I had was at Amount, and in a work setting, and especially at this age, I only had visibility over a select portion of the apps that we were actively developing on.

It was a very satisfying experience to be able to create something that other people will use. I really enjoyed being additive and adding value with the product that I built.

Building this app also helped me appreciate all the other roles that are involved in the software development process, such as project and product management because I had to play those roles as well. It helped me expand my perspective of what really the product is. I realize how that I had sort of a software ego before this project.
