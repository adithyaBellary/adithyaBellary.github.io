## Building a v1 product

A little over a year ago, around March of 2020, a local tutoring group by the name of Emphasis Education approached me regarding some issues they were experiencing with their business operations. They primarily tutor the k-12 range of students and were looking to streamline their business in order to expand their reach and increase the number of services that they offer.

A main issue that they were looking to solve was their reduced ability to control the nature and style of their tutoring sessions. They employed additional tutors to teach This became more apparent with the Covid-19 pandemic in full swing. Tutoring admins could no longer have as much influence in their sessions. previously, they would have frequent meetings with their employees in order to check up on how sessions are going. there would be frequent opportunities to assess the progress of each student, and then correct their course if needed. but with the pandemic now, that in person interactionand valuable communication is lost. Since then, all the communication has moved to a virtual / asynchronous format. All communication, both formal and informal, has moved to text message, and that has forced the tutoring group in an unideal situation. The tutoring admins can now no longer have that close of a relationship with their tutor employees or the students. Everything has to be done virtually, and they were finding it difficult to be as effective on Zoom.

They understodd that the mobile application is still a form of virtual communication, but with their own custom application, they could ensure that they were always involved with the student-related information, and those interactions could happen in their own space. the communication was not mixed with all their other text conversations, so there was a sense of separation of spaces. Branding, user interactions, custom behaviors, this was all up to them now, and they could make specific requests regarding how they wanted the app to function. These are some of the reasons that Emphasis Education went with the custom application route instead of trying to make an existing platform work for them.

In addition, the increased use of text message as the source of communication between all the members of EMphasis Education as a result of the pandemic was a development group admins were not too thrilled about. There were concerns about requiring all members to provide their phone numbers as a primary source of communication. WHen the group was operating in a known community, people were okay with depending on text messages to communicate with their tutors, but there is a future now where a tutor and their student could possibly be strangers,

Only having text messaging as the means of communication could also present a problem with client retention. With the unsupervised nature of text messaging, malicious tutors could poach clients with lower prices or direct them to other tutoring organizations. Though this is unlikely, with the idea of expansion on the horizon, Emphasis is looking to do what

Emphasis Education is a tutoring group for k-12 students that is focused on developing individual relationships as well as personalized curricula to empower each child.

Over the past couple months, they were noticing some issues with their business operations that they were looking to solve as they looked to expand their client-base as well as increase the number of services that they offer.

Issues:
  - protecting users' privacy
  - not kissing mon enough
  - no real brand identity
  - weak control of what is going on between tutor employees and students

They were noticing that they were taking care of a lot of business operations manually. These small tasks were adding up over time, and as they were looking to expand and take on more students, the way they were running things was not scalable.

Their current method of communication was through text message. This makes sense when the community of students and tutors are tight-knit. But there will be a time in the future when a student and a tutor will be unknown to each other. Then, it would be not be approproate to require a phone number and mandate that important communication take place in that space.

They also wanted a way to develop their brand identity. They are a relatively small group, so they were looking for a way to distinguich themselves

Once we put all these issues into a pot together and stirred them around, the solution that made the most sense was to create a customized mobile application that would be able to check all of the boxes that they had.

### The stack

I decided to write the mobile application in React Native. Firebase for backend and database. NodeJS Server. Graphql to connect the two

Writing this app was a great learning experience because I got to try a lot of new things and explore new libraries. I really got to create something, and that was a fantastic experience. It really opened my mind up to what it meant to be a software engineer. The only other proper software engineering experience I had was at Amount, and in a work setting, and especially at this age, I only had visibility over a select portion of the apps that we were actively developing on.

It was a very satisfying experience to be able to create something that other people will use. I really enjoyed being additive and adding value with the product that I built.

Building this app also helped me appreciate all the other roles that are involved in the software development process, such as project and product management because I had to play those roles as well. It helped me expand my perspective of what really the product is. I realize how that I had sort of a software ego before this project.
