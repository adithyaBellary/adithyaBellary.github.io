## Building a v1 product

Last year, a couple Directors from a local tutoring group by the name of Emphasis Education approached me regarding some issues they were experiencing with their business operations. Emphasis Education and its tutor employees primarily work with students in the K-12 range as a way to support and enhance students' school curricula. As they looked to the future, they set their eyes on increasing their client base as well as expanding the number of services offered. With this in mind, they sought to position themselves to be able to solve their current bottlenecks.

we could start with the point that they were relying too much on text messaging as a source of communication. then from there outline the problems with text messaging

A main source of the issues that they were facing stemmed from their reliance on text messaging as a primary medium of communication. This was the means by which everyone - the directors, the tutor employees, and the students and their families all discussed everything from important lesson updates to casual conversations. Because of this, there appeared to be a fractured group culture. A user's casual, non-Emphasis Education conversations are in the same space as the Emphasis Education conversations, so it is hard to have a proper separation of concerns. All conversations now appear to have the same level of improtance. This surface-level feeling of disconnect is one thing, but it also presents a very real obstacle. It now beceomes much easier to lose important messages from a tutor in the sea of other communication going on simultaneously in the same space. Now this is affecting a tutor's ability to effectively conduct their sessions. Emphasis Education is now almost competing for a user's attention by conducting their work in this space.

There is also the issue of a bad actor tutor trying to poach clients. Every text message between tutors and students cannot be monitored, so it would be difficult to prevent this if it became an issue. Up until now, Emphasis Education was operating in a tight-knit space where this wasn't really a possibility. This was by no means at the top of the list issues, but the plan of expansion brings in lesser known individuals and the business needs to be protected.

These seemingly small flaws became much larger once the Covid-19 pandemic hit and all interactions moved to virtual and asynchronous. Previously, the problems with text messaging could be overlooked because there was plenty of in-person meetings to supplement tutoring operations. If there were some important breakthroughs or topics that had to be discussed, meetings at coffee shops or local libraries could be quickly scheduled. Now, that could no longer be depended on. The Emphasis Education directors felt like it was harder and harder to be aware of how individual students were doing, and gauging lesson progress became much more difficult. A much more smooth and robust means of a communication between all parties had to be adopted in order to keep providing students with quality education. In-class curricula were also suffering at this time as teachers and administrations had to quickly pivot to a whole new method of teaching.

As an up and coming tutoring group, primarily operating in the Chicago suburbs and acquiring students by word of mouth, they were also looking for ways to differentiate themselves. One way they envisioned that happening was through their brand identity. They wanted an opportunity to showcase what they value and what they can give to students of all kinds.

When we thought about a solution that would address all of these concerns, we came to the idea of creating a proprietary mobile application for the Emphasis Education community.

...But once we came to that place, we saw that we needed to further refine what this app would do, and more importantly, what it would be. What purpose would it serve to the Emphasis users? How heavy would the usage be? Would it supplement the current methods of communication or would it replace them entirely?

When we outlined the bottlenecks that we wanted the app to solve, it became clear that the primary function that this app would serve is communication between all the Emphasis Education members. That is, the directors, the tutors, the students, and the students' families. If nothing else, this app should smoothly facilitate communication between these parties.

On top of that, we decided that it should have some sort of user management that would be hidden by a permissions that only the Directors would have. This would allow them to access User profiles and check their progress and what classes they are taking. This would also allow them to organize users in a family structure. This is because of the younger age of some of the students who are getting tutored. If a student is in the 1st grade, then it is very much likely that their parents would also have a vested interest in their child's progress. By enabling a family structure in how the users are organized, we can allow a "Guardian" type account that could be related to a child.

Lastly, in an effort to establish the principles Emphasis Education stand for, we wanted this app to have a look and feeling of ease and simplicity. The app had very important functional uses, but the experience of using it mattered to us as well. The action of moving from page to page, communicating with tutors, and finding more about the services offered all play a major role in generating trust in Emphasis Education as an entity. The introduction of this app into their process would be a significant change, and making the user experience a key prioroty would ensure the onboarding of this app to go smoothly.

By taking text messaging out of the picture entirely and using only this app to communicate, we would be able to address some key pain points.

It would foster a greater sense of community because there is now a separate space where Emphasis Education related communication would take place. It would not be mixed in with all the other text messaging group chats and such. When a user would open this app, there would be a sense of purpose. By consolidating it all into one location, there is a much more cohesive feel when we think about Emphasis Education. The app would serve as a way to bring all the participants together and provide frictionless discussion. There would be no more risk of losing important information becuase there is only one place where it could be. Having a central location also gave the Directors an opportunity to present themselves how they really wanted to. The app gave them a captive audience, so now they could incorporate their values, mission statement, and who they were as educators into the app experience.

By creating a space that is solely for Emphasis Education, the Directors could also now take a much more involved role in how they wanted educate their students. Students' specific needs could now be met in a very precise manner. If one specifc student struggled to complete their weekly assignments, then an automatic push notification could be scheduled every 3 or 4 days reminding them of any incomplete work. If they learned better with a consistent practice, then daily assignments could be configured in the app. Instead of tasks such as these taking up valuable time of the administrators, they could be programmatically configured.

A convenvient scheduling interface could also be incorporated in the app. Currently, sessions are scheduled and rescheduled with a lot of back and forth between the students, their tutors, and the directors. Creating tooling that could empower clients to meet their own needs gives them a sense of agency in their own learning journey.

Jobs such as these that are currently done manually, but do not need to be, were prime targets to be converted as responsibilities of the app. The idea for this solution was to streamline business operations as well as enable scaling in the near future, so the highly customizable and automatable nature of a mobile application looked very appealing.

## The Stack

Now that we had decided what we wanted the app to do, I had to build it. The first choice that I had to make was regarding the stack that i would use. Making an app could happen in many different ways. There were a lot of frameworks and options out there, so outlining what we wanted to the app to do was helpful in making this decision.

I decided to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to create the client side of the application. One main reason was because Emphasis Education had clients that used both iOS and Android devices. React Native is a framework and library used for writing both iOS and Android apps using JavaScript. By using Recat Native, I would not have to write two separate apps (one for iOS and one of Android). For the backend, I decided to use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which is a BAAS (backend-as-a-service) that offered database, authentication, and user management services. With Firebase, I would not need to look to multiple third party services to get everything i need, so that was an easy choice. And lastly, I needed a service to essentially connect the client to the backend. When the app is requesting data from the database, there are a couple ways that connection can happen. I chose to go with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) because of its ease of use and growing position in the industry marketplace. These various tools also worked very well together, so I knew it would make building out the client application and the serverside serivces simpler.

### Challenges

The process of building everything -- the client application, the server services, the data schema -- was an experience to say the least. And one that took significantly longer than I thought it would. When this project was initially brought to me, I had a partner to help me make this app. However, due to changes location and employment, he had to drop off the project, leaving just me to take on all of the development and testing. That considerably modified the initial timeline that we had agreed upon with the Emphasis Education directors. Another reason the app took much longer than expected was due to the expanded scope along the way.

In retrospect, the requirement gathering process in the very beginning could have been longer. When we were outlining exactly what features we wanted this app to have, we were very general. "A user management interface" read one bullet point. I would soon learn that that statement by no means accurately describes what I should build. Specific features and behaviors were not strictly defined, so there was uncertainty around when exactly I would be done with a feature. Would this user management interface include a search user feature? What fields on a user would a Director be able to search on? I don't know, and neither do they because we did not say so in the initial product outline. Looking back we were too eager to get started. I saw a shiny new project and couldn't help myself. And it was my first time doing a project as big as this so no obstacle was too big that it couldn't be addressed farther down the line. But that eagerness played a role in our failure to solidify specifications of the app.

Communicating those specifications with the Directors, who in the scenario acted as the product owners, also presented some challenges. I found it difficult at times to communicate the minutae of how the app would behave. I would often times revert to an overly technical explanation of functionality - an language that the layperson might not speak. I would mention screen refresh cycles, cache, and component mounting when talking about I was building the app. These words didn't mean much to them when they were asking broad questions about how they would use certain features. This also contributed to the enlongated timeline of the project. We would agree on a set of functionality in the beginning, but then once that feature was complete, we would find that we had misunderstood what the other had said. Either them, or I, would have made some costly assumption about the app structure, and then that would immediately add to our stradily growing pile of technical debt. The saying "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it" rang in my head many times. And here I saw how accurate that statement was. I saw how my own understanding of certain react native aspects were lacking, so I saw that I needed to regularly do another level of research before agreeing to a set of features. This method of communication did improve as time went on, but the inital setbacks had already done considerable damage to our expectations.

### Design choices / architecture

One benefit of the project taking 14 months vs the 4 I had foolishly thought was that it allowed for a maturity along the way on my part. I could actually learn along the way and improve my process as I progressed through the features, rather than staying with my existing mindset from the very beginning. Along the way, I could consult experts as to the proper way to structure databases, build React components, and even higher level ideologies such as my view on technical debt.

Perhaps the most important methodology that I picked up along this way was the idea of creating an application using a Schema-first-design. The Schema, on a high level, is the data contract between the client and the server. It defines the shape of the data objects stored, as well as what to expect from all service calls. Having these relationships can be seen as restrictive, but that is kind of the point. The client should know exactly what kind of data is to be expected from the database, and the server should know exactly what the client will be asking for. A Schema-first-design encourage to write the schema before writing any code. Although this would then delay creating components and defining architecture, this time being spent now will get paid back with dividends farther down the line. Establishing this agreement between these two parties then allows the development of each to happen independent of each other. The schema is by no means inflexible, however. If farther down the line we see the need to add a field or two an object, that can still can happen. The schema just requires that both the client and server are aware and agree to this change. Once that happens, then we can go right back to independent development.

I enjoyed this part of the project the most. It allowed me to make high level database architecture decisions. Decisions that I had not been in a positon to make before. I got to try my hand at understanding relationships between objects and how to make those the most efficient. Owning all the pieces to this project kept me from kicking the can down the road. If I said "someone will fix this later", there was no mystery on who that "someone" would be. I was forced to make educated decisions about a domain I had little experience with, so dilligent research was very important. It was a terrific learning experience being accountable to myself. It made me a more deliberate and knowledgeable software engineer.

My understanding of technical debt also evolved throughout the course of this project. Previously, I had a negative view of tech debt. It was the mark of a bad decision or oversight on the part of the developer. Why couldn't they just do it right the first time? Then we wouldn't have to take care of this farther down the road? Didn't they know that by doing things that way, they are just making more work for themselves in the future? Again -- why didn't they just do things the right way?

But, in reality, accruing tech debt is the cost of doing business. In a way it is inevitable. There are obviously best practices that should be employed along the way to reduce the amount of tech debt that is accumulated, but it is very hard to move forward through a project with the mindset of 0 tech debt. My distaste for tech debt came from my overlooking a key aspect in project management -- the fact that projects have deadlines. They don't just exist in vacuums; there are multiple groups of people looking for it and you have an obligation to get the products that were promised to them in a timely manner. If this was a personal project that no one was depending on, then I could take all the time in world to explore all possible avenues. But this is a different situation.

A quote I came across during my time working on this project went like this -- "Were I to await perfection, my book would never get finished." That really stuck with me. The idea of how we view our work, and the expectations that we have for it. How perfection, something we all strive for, can often times get in the way of actually completing our goals. It becomes this unattainable standard and puts us in a position where we cannot even finish the idea that we love so much. I wonder how many ideas perfection has killed.

I carried this idea with me, and it reminded me how everything is a process. Including software development. Our code goes through so many iterations and changes. Constantly becoming something different, something new, something better. And that is beautiful. The joy now lies in the pursuit of perfection, not perfection itself. And I think I like that better. It means that there are always more opportunities to learn, grow, improve. I imagined completing this project, making it perfect -- whatever that means -- and then stopping, staring at my screen. I imagine a feeling of "what now" in that moment. So I would much rather be in a space where I can keep leveling up, finding the next best thing. And in a way, that is what tech debt represents. It is a product of the idea that there can always be improvements to what we do. If we are not in a place where we are satisfied, that is okay. We room to grow.

There is a reason this post is called "building a v1 product." Emphasis on the v1 part. This is the first pass at solving the issues in front of me. It is hard to see that at the end of this phase, this application will be in a position to address each and every problem that might come up in the future. Libraries change, best practices change, our expactations of the product change, I will even change. I began to understand that this product will change in the future to be its best version of itself in that time, and there is beauty in that.

### Methodology
When deciding more of the specifics of certain services included in this app, the "Jobs to be done" framework really helped.

Also helped
client vs server responsibilities

### What I learned
The most important part of a project is the beginning. A good foundation goes a long way.
plan plan plan

They understood that the mobile application is still a form of virtual communication, but with their own custom application, they could ensure that they were always involved with the student-related information, and those interactions could happen in their own space. the communication was not mixed with all their other text conversations, so there was a sense of separation of spaces. Branding, user interactions, custom behaviors, this was all up to them now, and they could make specific requests regarding how they wanted the app to function. These are some of the reasons that Emphasis Education went with the custom application route instead of trying to make an existing platform work for them.

In addition, the increased use of text message as the source of communication between all the members of EMphasis Education as a result of the pandemic was a development group admins were not too thrilled about. There were concerns about requiring all members to provide their phone numbers as a primary source of communication. WHen the group was operating in a known community, people were okay with depending on text messages to communicate with their tutors, but there is a future now where a tutor and their student could possibly be strangers,

Only having text messaging as the means of communication could also present a problem with client retention. With the unsupervised nature of text messaging, malicious tutors could poach clients with lower prices or direct them to other tutoring organizations. Though this is unlikely, with the idea of expansion on the horizon, Emphasis is looking to do what

Emphasis Education is a tutoring group for k-12 students that is focused on developing individual relationships as well as personalized curricula to empower each child.

Over the past couple months, they were noticing some issues with their business operations that they were looking to solve as they looked to expand their client-base as well as increase the number of services that they offer.


They were noticing that they were taking care of a lot of business operations manually. These small tasks were adding up over time, and as they were looking to expand and take on more students, the way they were running things was not scalable.

Their current method of communication was through text message. This makes sense when the community of students and tutors are tight-knit. But there will be a time in the future when a student and a tutor will be unknown to each other. Then, it would be not be approproate to require a phone number and mandate that important communication take place in that space.

They also wanted a way to develop their brand identity. They are a relatively small group, so they were looking for a way to distinguich themselves

Once we put all these issues into a pot together and stirred them around, the solution that made the most sense was to create a customized mobile application that would be able to check all of the boxes that they had.

### The stack

I decided to write the mobile application in React Native. Firebase for backend and database. NodeJS Server. Graphql to connect the two

Writing this app was a great learning experience because I got to try a lot of new things and explore new libraries. I really got to create something, and that was a fantastic experience. It really opened my mind up to what it meant to be a software engineer. The only other proper software engineering experience I had was at Amount, and in a work setting, and especially at this age, I only had visibility over a select portion of the apps that we were actively developing on.

It was a very satisfying experience to be able to create something that other people will use. I really enjoyed being additive and adding value with the product that I built.

Building this app also helped me appreciate all the other roles that are involved in the software development process, such as project and product management because I had to play those roles as well. It helped me expand my perspective of what really the product is. I realize how that I had sort of a software ego before this project.
